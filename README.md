# sgx-actionscript
The SGX library, written in Actionscript 3. Released under the GPL.

## About

This is a cut-down version of the SGX engine to enable projects like EMF to be released under open source licenses, such as the GPL.

The _full_ SGX library is still under copyright in its entirety. You can not distribute the full version with GPL software. Thus, the necessity of releasing this GPL version.

## Disclaimer

This code was written in 2011. It is now 2018. I have no way of ensuring that it builds, or is even useful. It is provided as a historical document, although I am always happy to help support all of my projects should someone find a use for/problem with the code!

(The same is true of the 'Teeth Defender' example.)
